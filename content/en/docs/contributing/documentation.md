# Getting started

For contributing you will need the following:
- git installed, this will most likely already be the case
- a GitHub account
- a text or markdown editor like VSCode
- some knowledge of markdown ([guide to markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax))
- nodejs (optional) for previewing your changes on a local website

To set up your editing environment you will need to fork and clone the [repository](https://github.com/an-anime-team/docs). The follwing will show you how to create your own copy (fork) and download (clone) it.

Open the repository in a browser, log in to GitHub and click on "Fork" in the top right. Just click on "Create fork" in the next step and you will have forked the repository!

To clone your fork type `git clone https://github.com/[your GitHub username]/docs.git` into a terminal and git will create a directory named docs and download the repository there.

Now you just need to edit something!

# Uploading your edits

After you are done with your edits you will need to commit your changes with `git commit -m 'I changed something'` and push your changes with `git push`. If you are prompted for your GitHub credentials you will most likely need to create an [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

Next open your repository, click on "Contribute" and open a pull request.
